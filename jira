	•	Implement connectivity to the Observability stack (metrics, logs, traces)

⸻

5️⃣ Testing & Validation
	•	Validate Kafka topic functionality
	•	Test filtering logic
	•	Perform end-to-end data flow testing
	•	Validate observability metrics/logs
	•	Conduct UAT with SMEs/consumers

⸻

6️⃣ Deployment & Go-Live
	•	Perform deployment via Terraform pipeline
	•	Validate post-deployment state
	•	Enable monitoring & alerting
	•	Handover to operations/support

⸻

7️⃣ Documentation & Handoff
	•	Finalize architecture diagrams
	•	Update runbooks and SOPs
	•	Provide KT to SRE/operations teams
	•	Close project with sign-off

If you want, I can also format this into:

✔ A PDF
✔ A PPT
✔ A Jira story/epic structure
✔ A Visio-style workflow diagram

Just tell me which one you need.

Below is a clean, production-ready Jira Epic → Story → Sub-task structure based on your whiteboard content.
This is exactly how it should look when creating work items in Jira.

⸻

📌 JIRA EPIC

EPIC: Implement End-to-End Data Ingestion & Connectivity Pipeline (Kafka + Terraform + Observability)

⸻

📌 JIRA STORIES & SUB-TASKS

⸻

User Story 1: Requirement Gathering & Analysis

As a Platform/Integration Engineer
I want to gather requirements and understand the current system
So that I can design and implement the target Kafka-based solution.

Sub-Tasks
	1.	Identify SMEs and schedule requirement sessions
	2.	Capture functional and non-functional requirements (SLAs, throughput, consumers)
	3.	Document current-state architecture and data flow
	4.	Identify all existing consumers and output systems
	5.	Create requirements summary document and circulate for sign-off

⸻

User Story 2: Target-State Architecture & Design

As a Solution Architect
I want to design the target state for the ingestion pipeline
So that the implementation aligns with business and technical goals.

Sub-Tasks
	1.	Define target architecture diagram
	2.	List implementation steps and dependencies
	3.	Identify updates needed in Terraform module(s)
	4.	Define Kafka topic structure (name, partitions, replication, retention)
	5.	Review design with SMEs and finalize

⸻

User Story 3: Terraform Implementation

As a Platform Engineer
I want to implement the infrastructure changes using Terraform
So that the environment can be provisioned reliably and consistently.

Sub-Tasks
	1.	Update or create Terraform module for Kafka components
	2.	Add configurations for Kafka topics, ACLs, and retention policies
	3.	Implement required cloud resources (IAM, security groups, networking)
	4.	Validate Terraform plan & fix issues
	5.	Execute Terraform apply in dev → stage → prod environments

⸻

User Story 4: Kafka Topic Setup & Configuration

As a Kafka Engineer
I want to set up the Kafka topic and configure required properties
So that producers and consumers can interact with it reliably.

Sub-Tasks
	1.	Create Kafka topic per design
	2.	Configure partitions, replication, and retention
	3.	Set ACLs and schema registry rules (if applicable)
	4.	Validate topic creation in non-prod
	5.	Promote topic to production

⸻

User Story 5: Implement Filtering / Transformation Logic

As a Data Pipeline Engineer
I want to build filtering/transformation logic
So that only required data is passed to downstream systems.

Sub-Tasks
	1.	Identify filters/transformation rules
	2.	Implement filtering logic
	3.	Implement transformation/enrichment components
	4.	Perform functional testing of logic
	5.	Validate performance and latency

⸻

User Story 6: Implement Connectivity to Downstream Outputs

As a Integration Engineer
I want to connect Kafka data streams to the required output systems
So that downstream consumers receive the required data.

Sub-Tasks
